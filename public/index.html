Instructions
============

1. Generate a table using the data in the <script> tags below.
   The table columns should be generated *dynamically* based on the data. They
   should not be hardcoded - i.e., do not write "Username", "Identifier", etc.
   in your code.
2. Clicking on a table header should sort the table by the column that was
   clicked on. Clicking the same column a second time should sort in descending
   order.

You may use third-party libraries such as React or jQuery, but you cannot use
any third-party table components such as https://datatables.net/.

Feel free to style the table however you like with CSS.
